# This is source only for login shells 
# This file is sourced before .zshrc

# It is NOT the place for alias definitions, options,
# environments variable settings, etc 
#
# This file is an alternative to .zlogin
# You are not meant to use .zprofile and .zlogin together
# You decided to use .zlogin since you have the path 
# properly setup when .zlogin runs
