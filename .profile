# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022


# so in principle we don't use this file we put everything in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc 
# Things that ONLY run in interactive (login shells) should be put in ~/.bash_profile
# If it should be in both interactive and non-interactive shells then but it in ~/.bashrc (most of the stuff)
